# Claude.MD - Golf Sim App Project Guide

## üî¥ CRITICAL WORKFLOW INSTRUCTIONS - FOLLOW EVERY SESSION

### These 4 rules MUST be followed when working on the Golf Sim App project:

1. **START OF CONVERSATION:** Always read `planning.MD` first to understand current project state and priorities
2. **BEFORE STARTING WORK:** Check `tasks.MD` to see what needs to be done and avoid duplicate work
3. **AFTER COMPLETING WORK:** Immediately mark completed tasks in `tasks.MD` with completion date/time
4. **DURING WORK:** Add any newly discovered tasks or requirements to `tasks.MD` as you find them

### MCP Tool Integration (When Available):
- **Session Start:** Load previous context from Claude Context MCP
- **Task Creation:** Convert completed tasks to GitHub issues  
- **Decision Storage:** Save architectural decisions to vector database
- **Sprint Planning:** Use GitHub Project Manager for milestone tracking

```bash
# Session Start Checklist:

## API Design Patterns

### RESTful Endpoints Structure
```javascript
// Members
GET    /api/members
POST   /api/members
GET    /api/members/:id
PUT    /api/members/:id
DELETE /api/members/:id

// Bookings
GET    /api/bookings
POST   /api/bookings
GET    /api/bookings/:id
PUT    /api/bookings/:id
DELETE /api/bookings/:id

// Square Integration
POST   /api/square/charge
POST   /api/square/tab/create
POST   /api/square/tab/close
GET    /api/square/transactions

// GHL Integration
POST   /api/ghl/trigger/booking-confirmation
POST   /api/ghl/trigger/reminder
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Payment Security:**
   - PCI compliance required
   - Never store raw card data
   - Use Square's secure tokenization
   - Implement proper SSL/TLS

2. **Authentication:**
   - JWT tokens for session management
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Secure password hashing (bcrypt)
   - 2FA for admin accounts (optional)

3. **Data Protection:**
   - HTTPS everywhere
   - Input validation/sanitization
   - SQL injection prevention
   - Rate limiting on APIs

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Business logic (booking rules, pricing)
- Integration endpoints
- Validation functions

### Integration Tests
- Square API workflows
- GHL automation triggers
- End-to-end booking flow

### User Acceptance Tests
- Member can book a bay
- Staff can process payments
- Tabs auto-close properly
- Reminders send correctly
